A place to put my personal programming-related to-do list. This is mainly for me (and anyone interested)

- Update RGFW 
- Make sure the dynamic features work (no RGFW, feature removal, ect)

# RGFW
- MacOS Drag & Drop
- Ensure EGL support works (low priority)
- WebASM support? (low priority)

# PureDOOM-RGFW
- update RGFW

# RSGL-DOOM

- add new features (low priority) 

# PureDuke.h
